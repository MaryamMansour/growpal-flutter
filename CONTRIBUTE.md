# Basic Structure
We have dart files for every page, and dart files for specific widgets used inside the dart files for pages. These can be found under the `src/` folder. 

# PR Guidelines
- Include a reference to the Issue it is addressing
- Include a title that provides a one sentence overview of the PR
- Contain a description well written and understood

# Issue/Bug guidelines
Please start working on the issue only once the maintainer has assigned it to you. Working on it without information to the maintainer might make your work redundant and you will end up wasting your precious time at Hacknight!
